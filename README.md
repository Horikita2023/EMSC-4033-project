# The USGS earthquake data apply to Australia

### Instructions

This project is to apply USGS earthquake data to Australia. In this project, it shows earthquake points in different megnitude and reach their information 
 directly in a simple area sort program, and user can get the updated information of the nearest earthquake by themselves. The main introduction is in the `project` folder's `ProjectReport` file, you can find step by step instruction and the dependencies needed for this program.
 
### The main functions of this program

The first part is calculator to find how many earthquakes during the time user choose in Australia.

The second part earthquake points will be ploted onto the map.

The third part user can choose a state and get the point map of this state.

The fourth part user can get the detail information of the earthquakes in this state. 

The final part user can input the coordinate they are and get the nearest earthquake's information.
 
### code folder

This folder only has an `API.py` file, which is used to get data from USGS webpage, you can put it into the title of each part in my program, in order to reduce the 
work. Attention: the first part which get earthquake number is different from this API.

### notebook folder

Here is the main program and there's instructions in the code.

### project folder

Here's `ProjectPlanner.md` and `ProjectReport.md`, the former intruduce the basic information of the project and the later introduce the project in detial.

### test folder

here is the test file, include `functions.py`, `dependencies.py` and `test_earthquake.py`, this is the test wheather this program can run properly. The `tests.ipynb` isthe result of the test.
